            p.title BACK END
            p.about I aim to develop applications that are scalable, reliable, and mantainable. I like to work with Node and the rich ecosystem of libraries that the NPM offers. I have built apps with the powerful Meteor framework, but I prefer the classic Express. To use, or not to use a relational data model? No problem! I am comfortable with MongoDB and MySQL. 
            p.title FRONT END
            p.about I strive to implement applications that look and feel great across devices. Anytime design is involved, I let my creativity run free to create elegant interfaces that feature a smooth user experience. I usually let Angular and jQuery do the power lifting, but I have a feeling I'll be trying out React and Vue in the very near future. Frameworks are friends, but sometimes pure JS is the way to go.

        p.title A LITTLE ABOUT ME 
        p.about-more I'm a twenty-two year old programmer from Cuernavaca, Mexico. I'm currently based in Dallas, but I call Austin, Texas home. Don't let my portfolio fool you into thinking I'm only about CS! I'm actually really interested in mathematics as well, and I do not rule out the possibility of a mathematical career in the future. I have a penchant for treating programming problems mathematically and solving them analytically. Here's a #[a(class='fibo-link') cool] example. When I'm away from the keyboard, I like to stay fit, read anything from non-fiction to high fantasy, and play chess.
